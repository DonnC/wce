# WhatsApp Cloud Engines
This repo houses the documentations for [Jawce](https://github.com/DonnC/jawce) Java WhatsApp Cloud engine and [pywce](https://github.com/DonnC/pywce) Python whatsapp cloud engine.

These `"engines"` are template-driven whatsapp chatbot builders designed for you to focus on conversation flow and chatbot business logic.

They abstract much of the tedious and repetitive tasks when developing chatbots like
- Session management
- Conversation flows
- Templates

allowing you to bootstrap any chatbot of any complexity with ease.

## Business Logic
Both projects gives the developer ability to `hook` business logic by means of reflection.

Different hooks can be hooked on any template to offer more advanced message processing.
