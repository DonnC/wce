title: WhatsApp ChatBot Engine
description: Core template engine

The core purpose of the library is to provide a template-driven WhatsApp ChatBot Engine

## Setup
Let's checkout an example conversation flow using YAML files

Your typical folder structure might be

```plain
chatbot-project-name/  
â”‚  
â”œâ”€â”€ .env 
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ config.py
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py             # FastAPI entry point  
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
â”‚  
â”œâ”€â”€ templates/          # YAML template files  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ template1.yaml  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ template2.yaml  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...  
â”‚  
â”œâ”€â”€ triggers/           # Trigger-related YAML  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ trigger.yaml  
â”‚  
â””â”€â”€ services/
â”‚  
â””â”€â”€ hooks/
|
â””â”€â”€ venv/
```

Typical `.env` configs
```env
  # as before

  START_STAGE=MAIN_MENU
  TEMPLATES_DIR=templates
  TRIGGERS_DIR=triggers
```

### Templates
Templates are the engine's first-class citizens. They are defined in any format or storage you prefer  (`yaml` and or `json` are supported by default) and you can store them in any location you prefer

```yaml
# template1.yaml
"MAIN_MENU":
  kind: button
  message:
    body: |
      Hi, I am WCE ðŸ¤–, your ERP System booking assistant.

      What would you like to do today?"
    buttons:
      - Book a demo
      - Help
  routes:
    "book a demo": "BOOK_STAGE"
    "help": "HELP_MENU"

"BOOK_STAGE":
  kind: button
  message:
      body: "Start your system demo booking request by clicking the start button"
      footer: ERP Demo
      buttons:
      - Start
      - Return
  routes:
      "start": "START_BOOKING"
      "return": "MAIN_MENU"

# .. more templates
```

<Info>
  Internally, the engine understand `EngineTemplate` model.

   If you define your own `IStorageManager` you need to make sure you map your template data into this model class

### Webhook Handler
I prefer processing webhook data in background using Fastapi background tasks. You can use a similar approach for your framework or implementation.


```python
# ~imports
from .config import whatsapp, engine

# ... same as before in Standalone section

async def task(payload: dict, headers: dict) -> None:
    await engine.process_webhook(webhook_data=payload, webhook_headers=headers)

@app.post("/chatbot/webhook")
async def handler(request: Request, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    """Handle incoming webhook events from WhatsApp and process them in the background."""
    payload_bytes = await request.body()
    payload = whatsapp.util.bytes_to_dict(payload_bytes)

    # Add processing task to background
    background_tasks.add_task(task, payload, dict(request.headers))

    # quickly return response to WhatsApp to avoid retries
    return "ack"
```

This is all that is needed to setup your chatbot with pywce. Remember, chatbot business logic is found in your template hooks.

Happy chatbot development ðŸ™‚ðŸ¤–
