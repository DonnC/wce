description: Core template engine

The core purpose of the library is to provide a template-driven WhatsApp ChatBot Engine

From now on, we will focus on the engine part of the library

<Info>
  The example below uses Fast Api

  The previous section setup still applies.

### Engine Setup
The previous section touches on using pywce as just another WhatsApp Client Library. 
Much of the setup remains the same, what differs is how the webhook payload is processed, lets dive deep.

### Templates
Templates are the engine's first-class citizens. They are defined in `.yaml` files and you can store them in any location you prefer

Let's checkout an example conversation flow

```yaml
"MAIN_MENU":
  type: button
  message:
    body: |
      Hi, I am WCE ðŸ¤–, your ERP System booking assistant.

      What would you like to do today?"
    buttons:
      - Book a demo
      - Help
  routes:
    "book a demo": "BOOK_STAGE"
    "help": "HELP_MENU"

"BOOK_STAGE":
  type: button
  message:
      body: "Start your system demo booking request by clicking the start button"
      footer: ERP Demo
      buttons:
      - Start
      - Return
  routes:
      "start": "START_BOOKING"
      "return": "MAIN_MENU"
```
