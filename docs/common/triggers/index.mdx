title: Template trigger
description: Conversation starter / templates redirect

Most chatbots have a start word(s) or just a keyword that can trigger a certain flow to kick in. 
For example, most chatbots respond when you say `hie` or `start` or something similar. These are the
`triggers` in WCE context. They not only work for "greeting" but are very powerful features that can boost your bot intelligence and UX.

Triggers are global, and they are evaluated first when the engine is looking for the next stage to render.

For example. Consider a trigger defined as below
```yaml
"MAIN_MENU": "re:^start$"
```

The trigger above mean that, whenever user types `start` -  render the **MAIN_MENU** template to the user

    To define `regex` triggers, always prefix them with `re:`.

It's advised to have your triggers as exact regex to avoid unexpected responses ðŸ˜•.

You can also use a hacky way to redirect users to a specific template if they type your defined trigger shortcut command.
```yaml
"BOOK_DEMO_STAGE": "re:^book demo$"
```
