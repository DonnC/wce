description: template storage management
---

The storage manager handles only 2 tasks:
1. Get a template by stage name
2. Get all defined triggers

By implementing this class, it gives you option to define your own template storage source.

<Info>
    WCE comes with default `StorageManager` implementation out-of-the-box

    It comes with YAML templates support by default.

## Manager interface signature
Below is the interface you can implement to define your own custom template source.

```python
class IStorageManager(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for different templates storage sources."""

    @abstractmethod
    def load_templates(self) -> None:
        """(Optional) Load chatbot templates."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def load_triggers(self) -> None:
        """(Optional) Load chatbot triggers."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def exists(self, name: str) -> bool:
        """Check if a template stage exists."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def triggers(self) -> List[EngineRoute]:
        """Get all triggers"""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def get(self, name: str) -> EngineTemplate:
        """Load a single template by its name (stage)"""
        pass
```

> You wont necessarily interact with this manager implementation as it is used heavily internally by the engine.
