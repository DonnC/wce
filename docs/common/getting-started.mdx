<Warning>
  I assume you have your WhatsApp account and credentials in place
</Warning>

Checkout the corresponding WCE above for full details on engine configuration.
The basic steps to configure each of the engine is as below

<Steps>
    <Step title="Clone engine" icon="git">
        Clone or download your preferred engine repository:

        ```bash
        # java
        git clone git@github.com:DonnC/jawce.git
        ```

        ```bash
        # python
        git clone git@github.com:DonnC/pywce.git
        ```

        After successful clone, open the project in an IDE of your choice
        (Both engines are developed using JetBrains IDEs)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install dependencies" icon="cloud-arrow-down">
        For `JAWCE` - Install project maven dependencies

        For `PYWCE` - Pip install requirements in `requirements.txt`

        From now on, we will focus on the `example` folder with the sample chatbot
    </Step>
    <Step title="Setup Credentials" icon="user-lock">
        Remember the WhatsApp Credentials we mentioned?

        #### For Java
            Navigate to the `/jchatbot/src/main/resources/application.yml` properties file and replace secret keys with your
            account credentials
            ```yaml
            chatbot:
                configs:
                    # ...
                    hub-token: "replace-with-your-hub-token"
                    access-token: "replace-with-your-access-token"
                    phone-number-id: "replace-with-your-phone-number-id"
            ```

        #### For Python
            Navigate to the `Settings.py` file and set your configs appropriately
    </Step>
    <Step title="Test Run" icon="whatsapp">
        #### For Java
            Before you run the project, setup the full path to the project resources folder

            ```yaml
            resources:
                templates: ..full/path/to/templates
                triggers: ..full/path/to/triggers
                watcher: ..full/path/to/watch
            ```

            E.g If you cloned the project in

            `C:\Users\me\projects\jawce`

            Your path folders will be as

            `C:\\Users\\me\\projects\\jawce\\example\\jchatbot\\src\\main\\resources\\templates`

            If all goes well,

            Start your development server

            Run the `chatbot` project, if all goes well. It should run on the port configured in the application properties file.

            ---

        #### For Python
            The sample chatbot uses FastApi. Ensure `fastapi` is installed
    </Step>
    <Step title="Webhook Config" icon="globe">
        If the example chatbot run successfully. You can configure `NGROK` or any other tunneling services to tunnel your local setup to obtain an HTTPS webhook
        to configure on Meta developer portal.

        In a new terminal, do
        ```bash
        ngrok http <service port>
        ```

        The webhook url will be accessible on `https://ngrok-url/jawce/webhook` for `JAWCE` and `https://ngrok-url/pywce/webhook` for `PYWCE`.

        You can use the generated https url to configure on your meta developer application portal as below

        Example dev console portal config
