The basic steps to configure each of the engine is as below

## How WCE works
WCE engine approach is straight forward

1. Imagine user starts your chatbot for the first time. The usual `hie` or `start`
2. The engine checks for the current stage in the session (no conversational template stages found at this stage), and it takes the start template that you configure and set it as the current template.
3. It evaluates this current template `hooks` (or call them template guardrails) and processes all `PRE-HOOK`s on it.
4. It processes, renders the template as a proper WhatsApp message and send to user. (a lot more happens under the hood)
5. When a user respond to that message via WhatsApp, the engine lookup the current template in the session and processes all `POST-HOOKS` on it.
6. The engine checks for the `routes` defined on the current template and maps them to the user input and their next logical template stage
7. If a mapping is found, it sets it as current template and the process repeats from `step 2` 

The process repeats on and on üîÅ

## Main Components
The engine has main components which you need to understand.

1. Templates - conversational flow
2. Triggers - conversation starters
3. Hooks - supercharge template with business logic

Let's dive deep into these components.
