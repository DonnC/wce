WhatsApp introduced [flows](https://business.whatsapp.com/products/whatsapp-flows), mobile-app-screen like message types.

This type makes collecting user information a breeze and greatly improves your chatbot UX

**WCE** has out-of-the box support for flows. An example flow template will be as below

```yaml
"STAGE_NAME":
  type: flow
  message:
    id: flow-id
    name: flow-name
    title: "My Flow Title"
    body: "Flow message body"
    button: flow-btn
  routes:
    "re:.*": "NEXT_STAGE"
```

WCE tries to keep template signature similar, a flow template can have a `title`, `body` and or `footer`
like any other interactive message template.
