Hooks supercharge the **WCE** engines. It makes it possible to hook custom, additional functionality during message processing.

All chatbot business logic is defined in the corresponding hook.

## Hooks processing
Hooks that uses dotted path are processed using reflection API
> Learn more about [Java Reflection](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/)

> Learn more about [Python Reflection](https://gamedevacademy.org/python-reflection-tutorial-complete-guide/)

These are normal functions / methods that you define. Any hook must take a single argument **HookArg** object.

<Info>
    Session manager attribute gives you access to the engine session instance.

    ```python

        """
          takes default whatsapp user information

          :var name: default whatsapp user name
          :var wa_id: user mobile number

        name: str
        wa_id: str
        msg_id: str
        timestamp: str

        render_template_payload: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]

        Long timestamp
        ) {}

        WebhookResponseMessageType type,        // for dynamic template message type
        Map<String, Object> payload,            // used for `flow` type - initial flow data
        Map<String, Object> renderPayload       // dynamic template data
        ) {}

    // main model
    public class HookArgs {
        private WaCurrentUser channelUser;
        private String userInput;                           // user input from whatsapp
        private String flow;                                // flow name for flow template type
        private Map<String, Object> additionalData;         // mainly for dynamic routing
        private TemplateDynamicBody templateDynamicBody;    // for templates, dynamic and flow messages
        private Map<String, Object> methodArgs;             // provided static params defined on template
    }
    ```

<Info>
  The Hook model contains all the necessary data you can use in your business logic
</Info>

Hooks are classified as `PRE` & `POST` hooks - it can be processed before a message is sent to user or processed after a message is received from a user.

Hooks are normal functions or method, you will learn more under hooks section.

#### Supported hooks
**POST**
- `on-receive` processed after a message is received from a user. Main point of business logic after user sends a message. 
Use cases include: send email after user confirms order, process an order, validate user input etc.
- `middleware` processed after `on-receive` is processed. Meant for any business logic processed mid-flight 
- `router` is processed last and it by-pass the `routes` defined on the template. Its used to dynamically compute the next stage to go to (redirecting).

**PRE**
- `template` used for dynamically populating a dynamic data on the template.
Use cases: dynamically populate a button template, button label or template text 
- `on-generate` processed after `template` hook is processed. Meant for any business logic processed mid-flight before a message is shown to user

Let's look at each hook and how its business logic is defined.

<Info>
    **JAWCE** also supports `RESTFul` based hooks.
    Only JAWCE supports both reflective and restful based hooks
</Info>

<Info>
    **frappe-pywce** also supports `script` based hooks with limited support.
    These have a similar approach to Frappe API Server Scripts.
