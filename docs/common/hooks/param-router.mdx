title: Router Hook
description: Template redirects

The only job for this hook is to provide dynamic routing.

Wondering how to dynamically redirect user to a certain stage? Use the router to act as a route decider switch.

It is a `POST` hook that is processed before the engine decides the next route. If a router hook is defined, the template routes are ignored.

## Example
```yaml
"CLOSE_ACC_STAGE":
  kind: button
  router: "example.hooks.service.account_route_switch"
  message:
    title: Close Account
    body: "Confirm account type closure?"
    buttons:
      - Savings Account
      - Loan Account
  params:
    account-type: Individual
    currency: ZAR
  routes:
    "savings account": "ACCOUNTS_SAVING_STAGE"
    "loan account": "LOANS_STAGE"
```

In your business logic hook, you can do your decision making and redirect user like below

```python
# example/hooks/service.py
from pywce import HookArg, EngineConstants, hook

@hook
def account_route_switch(arg: HookArg) -> HookArg:
  # if params currency is ZAR, then
  # dynamically redirect user template stage
  # for collecting zar account details

  if args.params.get('currency') == 'ZAR':
      next_route = {EngineConstants.DYNAMIC_ROUTE_KEY: "REQUEST_ZAR_ACC_DETAILS_STAGE"}
      arg.additional_data = next_route

  return arg
```
