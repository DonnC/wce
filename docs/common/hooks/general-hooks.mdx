title: General Hooks
description: Common hooks implementation

This section will show how the general hooks are processed, These hooks include:

- on-receive       - `[POST]` logic to process after user responds / sends a message
- on-generate      - `[PRE]` logic to process before a template is processed for rendering to user
- template         - `[PRE]` usually used to dynamically create a template message body
- middleware       - `[POST]` middleware logic to process mid-flight
- validator        - `[POST]` logic specifically for handling any user data validation


Consider an example for `middleware` below

> The example below works for `on-receive`, `on-generate`, `middleware`, `validator` hooks

## Middleware
Imagine you want to do any general business logic mid-flight of the template processing.
You can define a `middleware` template just for that.

An example will be saving some data to the db or retrieving some and save them in the user session

```yaml
1000:
  type: text
  middleware: "example.engine_chatbot.hooks.account_service.fetch_accounts"
  message: "Type `transfer` to start funds transfer process"
  routes:
    "transfer": "FUNDS-TRANSFER"
    "no": "HOME"
```

When user responds, the hook will be processed.

Consider a sample business logic

<CodeGroup title="Middleware Hook">
  ```python
  # example.engine_chatbot.hooks.account_service.py

  from pywce import HookArg

  def fetch_accounts(arg: HookArg) -> HookArg:
    """
     fetch corresponding user accounts
     & save to user session
    """
    print(f"Received hook arg: {arg}")

    if arg.user_input.lower() == "transfer":
      user_accounts = AccountsManager(mobile=arg.user.wa_id).get_accounts()
    
      arg.session_manager.save(
        session_id=arg.user.wa_id,
        key="accounts",
        data=user_accounts
      )

    return arg
```

 ```java
// TODO: WIP
```
