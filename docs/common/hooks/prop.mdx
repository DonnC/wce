title: Prop
description: Save arbitrary user data to session / cache
---

If you have been developing websites, you probably come across this word. Here, Props are custom variables that you can use however you'd like -
to store data in the user session under that variable.

The engine keeps track of the user session props internally.

## Defining a prop

To define a prop on a particular template, provide the `prop` attribute with your defined variable name

```yaml
"ASK_NAME_STAGE":
  type: text
  prop: username
  message: "What is your name?"
  routes:
    "re:\\w+": "ASK_AGE_STAGE"
```

In the above template, when user provides a response, it will be saved in the user session props under the key `username`

You can then access this user session data in your bot business logic.
