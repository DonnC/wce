title: More Hook
description: A lot more on hooks

In this section, let's quickly go through more hooks

- params
- router
- checkpoint


## Checkpoint
Save a stage as a last access point: checkpoint.

One use case is to take your users back to their latest previous menu instead of taking them back to the very start menu.

## Ack (Bluetick âœ…)
As it says, it makes you acknowledge reception of a message (bluetick) on WhatsApp


## Params

Ever wanted to pass custom static data to your hooks? Use params (like functions parameters / method arguments)

<Info>Params can be applied to any type of message</Info>

Let's take a look at an example

<Tabs
    values={[
        { label: 'jawce', value: 'jawce' },
        { label: 'pywce', value: 'pywce' },
    ]}
>
    <TabItem value="jawce">
    ```yaml
    100:
      type: button
      on-receive: "com.example.jawce.service.AccountHook:processAccountRequest"
      message:
        body: "Confirm account type closure?"
        buttons:
          - Savings Account
          - Loan Account
      params:
        account-type: Individual
        currency: ZAR
      routes:
        "re:.*": "LOAN_PROCESSOR_STAGE"
    ```

    In your business logic hook, you can get the passed params as below
    ```java
    class AccountHook {
        private final HookArgs args;

        public AccountHook(HookArgs args) {
            this.args = args;
        }

        public Object processAccountRequest() {
            log.info("Process account args: {}", args);

            // access params
            var params = args.getMethodArgs();

            if(params.get("currency").equals("ZAR")) {
                // TODO: handle logic
            }

            return args;
        }
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="pywce">

```yaml
100:
  type: button
  on-receive: "example.hooks.service.account"
  message:
    body: "Confirm account type closure?"
    buttons:
      - Savings Account
      - Loan Account
  params:
    account-type: Individual
    currency: ZAR
  routes:
    "re:.*": "LOAN_PROCESSOR_STAGE"
```

In your business logic hook, you can get the passed params as below

```python

@hook
def account(arg: HookArg) -> HookArg:
  if args.params.get('currency') == 'ZAR':
      # TODO: implement business logic

  return arg
```

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Router

The only job for this hook is to provide dynamic routing.

Wondering how to dynamically redirect user to a certain stage? Use the router to act as a route decider switch.



<Tabs
    values={[
        { label: 'pywce', value: 'pywce' },
        { label: 'jawce', value: 'jawce' },
    ]}
>
    <TabItem value="jawce">
   

```yaml
100:
  type: button
  router: "com.example.jawce.service.AccountHook:routeSwitcher"
  message:
    body: "Confirm account type closure?"
    buttons:
      - Savings Account
      - Loan Account
  params:
    currency: USD
  routes:
    "re:.*": "LOAN_PROCESSOR_STAGE"
```

<Info>
  `EngineConstants.REST_HOOK_DYNAMIC_ROUTE_KEY` is an internal engine constant
  used to set the next dynamic route
</Info>

In your business logic hook, you can redirect user to another route like below

```java
class AccountHook {
    private final HookArgs args;

    public AccountHook(HookArgs args) {
        this.args = args;
    }

    public Object routeSwitcher() {
        log.info("Route switcher args: {}", args);

        var params = args.getMethodArgs();

        if(params.get("currency").equals("ZAR")) {
            args.setAdditionalData(
                    Map.of(
                            EngineConstants.REST_HOOK_DYNAMIC_ROUTE_KEY,
                            "REQUEST_ZAR_ACC_DETAILS_STAGE"
                    )
            );
        }

        return args;
    }
}
```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="pywce">

```yaml
100:
  type: button
  on-receive: "example.hooks.service.account_route_switch"
  message:
    body: "Confirm account type closure?"
    buttons:
      - Savings Account
      - Loan Account
  params:
    account-type: Individual
    currency: ZAR
  routes:
    "re:.*": "LOAN_PROCESSOR_STAGE"
```

In your business logic hook, you can do your decision making and redirect user like below

```python
@hook
def account_route_switch(arg: HookArg) -> HookArg:
  # if params currency is ZAR, then
  # dynamically redirect user template stage
  # for collecting zar account details

  if args.params.get('currency') == 'ZAR':
      next_route = {EngineConstants.DYNAMIC_ROUTE_KEY: "REQUEST_ZAR_ACC_DETAILS_STAGE"}
      arg.additional_data = next_route

  return arg
```

    </TabItem>

</Tabs>
