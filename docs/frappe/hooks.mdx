Due to the nature of the framework, a developer can define normal server side python scripts as hooks in frappe and reference them using their dotted path.

The app also enables you to define template hooks with a similar approach to that of [api server scripts](https://docs.frappe.io/framework/user/en/desk/scripting/server-script)

You can select your hook to be either `editor script` - similar to framework server scripts, directly via UI or `server scripts` - defined python functions on the backend as dotted path.

The templates message bodies are the json representations of the default YAML supported template messages.
